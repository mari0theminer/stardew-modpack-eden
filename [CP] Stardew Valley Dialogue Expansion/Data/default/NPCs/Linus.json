				"Mon4":"When berry season arrives, there's more than enough food to go around.#$e#You just have to know how to look for them, and they come in abundance.",
				"Mon6":"There's nothing like the feeling of making it through another winter with just the gifts of the mountain.$h",
				"Mon8":"Me? Married? Haha, no, I've never been married.$h#$e#I've never demanded that anyone else should conform to my lifestyle.",
				"Tue2":"Is there something that you want?",
				"Tue6":"A long time ago, yes, I grew up in a family. I haven't seen them for many years.#$e#I don't think I can even remember their faces anymore...$s",
				"Tue10":"Well, @, I suppose I could consider you a part of my new family, if that's alright.$h#$e#Oh, please don't be alarmed. The trees, the rocks, the lake, the sky... they are all my family, too.",
				"Wed4":"This land will continue to exist for many eons past our lifetimes.#$b#Please do treat it with respect.",
				"Thu":"...Hmm? Do you want something from me?",
				"Thu2":"...Maybe I need to pack up my tent and move again.$s",
				"Thu6":"Yes, you saw me taking food from the trash cans that one time...$s#$e#Usually, I just live on the food that nature provides, but the food that others throw out goes to complete waste if I don't take it.$s#$e#Is that any way to treat the world that provides for us?",
				"Thu8":"Sometimes, people don't understand me, but that doesn't make them bad.#$e#It just bothers me when they show hostility.",
				"Thu10":"There is a beauty in caring for others.#$b#So if I find something delicious and there's enough for two, I'll leave it in your mailbox.$h",
				"Fri":"Please don't destroy my tent.#$e#It's happened before.$s",
				"Fri2":"Why do you keep visiting me?",
				"Fri8":"Where do we go after we die? I suppose I'll go into the ground.#$e#Just back into the flow of nature, is all.#$e#It doesn't have to be so bad, if you think about it.#$e#I guess I'm not quite ready for that yet, though.$h",
				"Sat":"I'm happy by myself, you know.#$e#I don't need new friends.",
				"Sat2":"...Hello, again.",
				"Sat6":"I don't imagine I'll stay here much longer.#$e#Don't be alarmed if you come up here and my tent is suddenly gone.#$e#That's how I've always done it.",
				"Sat8":"Perhaps I'll stay here another year.#$e#I don't normally stay put in one place for this long, but...$s",
				"Sat10":"At this rate, I may just stay here indefinitely.$h#$e#I can live in nature as much as I want, but I'm not too far away from at least one good neighbor. Thank you, @.",

				"fall_Tue10":"Hi there, @!$h#$e#Find any good foraging spots today?",

				"fall_Sun10":"Have you tried fishing with wild bait yet?",
				"winter_Mon6":"I could hide indefinitely from the cold in the hot spring, but that isn't where I live.#$e#I'd rather not step on anyone's toes. The building belongs to the village.",
				"winter_Tue8":"If I play things right, I can go for a week or so without food.#$e#It isn't my first choice, but I can do it if it becomes necessary.",
				"winter_Wed8":"Rasmodius is a good friend. We only run into each other every now and then, but we always pick up where we left off.",
				"winter_Thu8":"The family in that house seemed annoyed by my presence when I first settled here. Lately, though, they seem fine with me.",
				"winter_Sun8":"It's important to know that we don't really matter. The world will carry on whether we humans exist or not.",
				"spring_1_2":"Breathe in that spring air!$h#$b#The valley is coming to life.$h",
				"summer_10":"I think I might take a risk tomorrow at the luau and share a little of my cooking.",
